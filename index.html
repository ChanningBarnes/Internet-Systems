            My name is Channing Barnes and I am a Junior Computer Science student at North Carolina A&T State University. I first and foremost seek to be a faithful follower of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who saved me when I was 18 years old. Outside of that, my interests including programming, music production, and YouTube. I also find family and friends to be extremely important, so I also spend a good deal of time fostering those relationships.
